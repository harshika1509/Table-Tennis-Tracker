#Table Tennis Bounce Point Calculation using Image Processing
####
Project Overview
This project aims to calculate the bounce points of a table tennis game using classical image processing techniques. By analyzing video footage of a table tennis match, we can determine where the ball bounces on the table. This information can be used for performance analysis, strategy development, and improving gameplay.

Features:

Video Processing: Load and process video files of table tennis matches.
Ball Detection: Identify and track the ball in each frame of the video.
Bounce Point Calculation: Determine the exact points where the ball bounces on the table.
Visualization: Display the bounce points on a graphical representation of the table.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
